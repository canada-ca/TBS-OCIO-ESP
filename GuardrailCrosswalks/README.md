# GC Cloud Guardrail Crosswalk With Cloud Provider Config Checks

This page is a work in progress. This is an experiment to crosswalk the GC Cloud Guardrails with the delivered configuration checks offered by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). This should not be viewed as TBS guidance.

## Azure
The Azure crosswalk can be found in the form of an [Excel spreadsheet](AzureCrosswalk.xlsx)


The checks are taken, primarily, from the Azure Defender [compliance checks for FedRAMP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/fedramp-moderate)

## AWS
Coming next
